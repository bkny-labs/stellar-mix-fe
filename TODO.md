# TODO

1. We gotta add AI in here =)
2. Gotta fix the janky loading, it should be easier to add parameters to the search that it is with this store setup...
3. Why does the sidebar and header not always load in when first authentication?
4. Play sometimes takes 2 clicks before it syncs with browse view state...
5. What settings do we REALLY need?
   1. What can be filters vs what needs to be in settings page?
6. Sup with the error about the date being passed into suncalc api?
7. Revamp homepage a bit, let's go.
8. Why can't we deploy exactly? There's some redirect still going to localhost from the Netlify build - need to investigate if the production env is actually being used or if there is a redirect somewhere in the app.
